   **Our obtained result on our website allowed us to input five different categories to filter the data: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.**

•	**The website displays all data by representing a well-structured table with UFO's sighting date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and additional comments.
•	We design our website by using JavaScript and HTML. 
•	 The user would be required to click on the input boxes. If you enter an incorrect filter or a variable that does not exist in the data, you will get no result displayed. In this case, try again.
•	To return to the original dataset (without filters included), click on the top left to say UFO Sightings, and the HTML will get redirected.**

 ### Summary



**The dataset used only includes sightings in the US. Only utilizing sightings in use may create limitations that may affect the website because it might not get as much attention from other parts of the World. Additionally, one recommendation could be to decorate the website further. CSS and Bootstrap have infinite options to make an even more aesthetically pleasing website.**
